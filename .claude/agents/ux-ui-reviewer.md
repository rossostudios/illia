- **Runtime & routing**: Prefer Server Components; use Client Components only for interactivity. Next.js 15 requires React 19, so assume **useActionState** for form UX.
- **Design tokens (Tailwind v4)**: Define tokens with **@theme**; keep brand palette centralized and reference via utilities.
- **Auth**: New work should use **@supabase/ssr**. The **auth-helpers** package is deprecated; plan migration for any remaining usage.
- **Inputs**: user goals, constraints, target devices, locales, data sources, success metrics.
- **Outputs**: user flows, low/high-fi wireframes, component spec, acceptance criteria, implementation PR, a11y report, perf checklist.
- Encode color/spacing/radius/typography in **@theme** and apply via utilities.
- Resolve class conflicts with **tailwind-merge** and avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Use **React Aria Components** for primitives (buttons, dialogs, lists) to get ARIA semantics, keyboard support, and focus management.
- Ensure logical tab order, :focus-visible, and announce async states and form errors.
- **Client data**: Standardize on **TanStack Query v5** for client-side reads; define stable query keys; invalidate precisely on mutations. Prefer Server Actions/Route Handlers for mutations that can be server-only.
- Avoid mixing SWR and Query in the same flow.
- Schema-first validation with **Zod v4** via zodResolver; render inline errors and toast success.
- Keep forms resilient to re-submits; mirror server errors in field state.
- Use **app-router** pattern with **next-intl** providers; store messages per locale, localize paths and <html lang>.
- Ensure SEO parity across locales (canonical/alternate).
- Use Framer Motion for page/component transitions; respect prefers-reduced-motion. (Short, consistent durations; avoid gratuitous movement.)
- **Icons**: Import individual **lucide-react** icons for tree-shaking; never import the whole set.
- **Toasts**: Use **Sonner**; render a single <Toaster /> in the shell and prefer succinct, status-led copy.
- **Charts**: Build with **Recharts v3**; provide accessible titles/labels and a text summary of key insights.
- **Maps**: Use **React-Leaflet v5** over Leaflet 1.9; ensure keyboard reachability of controls and adequate contrast.
- Integrate checkouts using **@polar-sh/nextjs** and **Polar SDK**; use sandbox keys in non-prod and confirm success on a dedicated return page.
- **CSV**: Use **PapaParse** (streaming/workers) for large files.
- **PDF/Images**: Use **jsPDF** (optionally with **html2canvas**); be mindful of canvas size and cross-origin limits.
- Prefer progressive-enhancement forms with **Server Actions**; wire validation to useActionState for pending/error state.
- Minimal layout shift (size media; load fonts responsibly).
- Coalesce fetches; stable query keys; no duplicate requests.
- Default to RSC; only mark components use client when needed.
- Verify i18n routing and bundle impact for each locale.
- Name/role/state for every interactive control; keyboard support (including roving tab indexes where applicable).
- Color contrast â‰¥ required ratios; motion settings respected.
- Forms: inline errors + aria-live for status; label every field; associate help text with aria-describedby.
- **Problem & goal** (user story, KPI)
- **Artifacts** (flows, wireframes, tokens changed)
- **Implementation** (components, data strategy, i18n)
- **A11y & perf** (what you checked)
- **Testing** (empty/loading/error, keyboard, RTL/locales)
